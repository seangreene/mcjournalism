The Journalism major program has a twofold purpose: to provide preparation for careers in news, entertainment and sports media, public relations and communications, and to provide a study of the media of mass communications.

<hr>

The Moorpark College Student Voice is an award-winning publication online and in print, distributed to the Moorpark College campus and surrounding communities. The print edition publishes three times per semester, while <a href="http://www.studentvoiceonline.com">StudentVoiceOnline.com</a> is published continuously throughout the academic year.

Students who want to share the camaraderie of working as a team toward a common goal should consider joining the Student Voice staff. Students in any of three CSU-transferable staff classes enjoy the hands-on experience of working in a newsroom to create journalistic stories in multiple media for publication online and in print. Jour M02, the foundational and transferrable course in reporting and writing, is highly recommended as a co-requisite or pre-requisite for any of the staff classes.

Students also participate in statewide competitions, workshops and conferences.
